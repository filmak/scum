% Thank Kris
First and foremost, I would like to thank my adviser, Professor Kristofer S. J. Pister, for his overwhelming support and mentorship throughout my undergraduate and graduate studies at UC Berkeley. His door was always open when I needed academic, research, and career advice, and his vast breadth of knowledge never ceases to amaze (and occasionally intimidate) me. I am honored to be one of his students.

% Thank SCM Team
I would also like to thank the Single Chip Mote team, Dr. Osama Khan, David Burnett, Brad Wheeler, and Filip Maksimovic, for their friendship, guidance, and inspiration during the course of this project and my graduate studies. I could not ask to work with a better group of engineers, and I hope that we can continue to collaborate on projects in the future.

% Thank Pister group and visiting scholars
% Swarm lab staff, students, visiting scholars, postdocs, faculty
I would also like to express my gratitude towards all of the students, postdocs, and visiting scholars both past and present within Professor Pister's research group, for their friendship, encouragement, and support, as well as the students and staff in UC Berkeley's Ubiquitous Swarm Lab.
